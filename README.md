# Decentralized Healthcare Data Exchange and Research Platform

## Overview
The **Decentralized Healthcare Data Exchange and Research Platform** is a blockchain-based system designed to facilitate the secure sharing of anonymized healthcare data for research purposes. It leverages smart contracts for access control, consent management, and automated compensation, ensuring data security, transparency, and fairness.

## Features
- **Secure Data Exchange**: Ensures privacy and security while enabling controlled access to healthcare data.
- **Smart Contracts**:
    - **Data Access Control**: Grants researchers permission to access data based on predefined conditions.
    - **Consent Management**: Allows patients and data providers to manage consent settings.
    - **Automated Compensation**: Ensures fair compensation for data providers based on data usage.
- **NFT Integration**:
    - **Data Contributions**: NFTs represent individual data contributions, allowing tracking and rewards.
    - **Research Milestones**: Recognizes significant research achievements via NFT minting.
- **Electronic Health Record (EHR) Integration**:
    - Enables seamless data exchange between healthcare institutions and research organizations.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Smart contracts deployed on a decentralized network.
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity/Clarity (depending on blockchain choice).
- **Storage**: IPFS/Arweave for decentralized data storage.
- **NFTs**: ERC-721/ERC-1155 for data contribution and milestone recognition.
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js for a user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API interactions.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for off-chain metadata management.

## How It Works
1. **Data Contribution**:
    - Healthcare providers or individuals submit anonymized data.
    - Data is hashed and stored securely.
    - A corresponding NFT is minted as proof of contribution.
2. **Consent Management**:
    - Users manage data-sharing permissions via smart contracts.
    - Changes are recorded immutably on the blockchain.
3. **Research Access**:
    - Researchers request access by fulfilling predefined conditions.
    - Smart contracts verify consent before granting access.
4. **Compensation Mechanism**:
    - Data providers are rewarded via tokens upon approved usage.
    - Research milestones trigger NFT-based recognition.
5. **Integration with EHR Systems**:
    - Secure APIs enable interoperability between healthcare systems and researchers.
